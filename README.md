# CHIPS-Project

Files:
CHIPS.py: This is our main driver file for our prject it will display all of the outputs for the project.
  
instructions.txt: This file will read in the instructions on how to play the game and it will print it our to the user in the terminal.

To run the code you will need python for Windows or python3 for Mac then CHIPS.py and then our name after CHIPS.py.

Once you do this you will be prompted to pick one or two chips that you would like to take our from the board that add up to your dice roll rangeing from 1-10. For example if you role a 6 and 5 you would take two chips that add up to 11 like 10 and 1. You willrepeat this process until all the chips are gone or until you can not remove chips that add up to the number that the dice roll. Once the game is over your score will be calculated and returned to you in the terminal.
